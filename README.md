# Toy-Neural-Network-Library
A neural network library using OOP which could generalize to more complex graphs and new layer types. 

The Sigmoid, Softmax and Tanh layers were implemented as classes. The .m files have the same names.

updateWeights, feedForward and backprop were implemented as functions. Again, the .m files have the same names.
